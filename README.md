🚀 Project Overview
This is a Student Grade Tracker built in Java.
It allows a teacher to:

Enter students' grades,

Calculate the average, highest, and lowest scores,

View student grades easily.

The program uses arrays to store student grades based on the number of students entered by the teacher.

🛠 Technologies Used
Java (Object-Oriented Programming - OOP)

Console-based interaction (Scanner class)

🧱 Project Structure

Class Name	Purpose
StudentGradeTracker	Handles input of grades and performs calculations (average, highest, lowest).

The teacher inputs each student's grade one by one.

Validation: Ensures that the entered grades are between 0 and 100.

Calculations:

The program calculates:

Average grade,

Highest grade,

Lowest grade.

Display Results:

It displays all the grades and the computed statistics.
